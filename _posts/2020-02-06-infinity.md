Infinity.

Or, as Python programmers like to refer to it:

    numpy.inf

As a mathematical notion, infinity can be rather complicated,
but as a programming notion it is perhaps a little bit easy.

In programming, infinity has two uses:

- a "true" infinity;
- the result of a computation that is _too large_.

Computers (typically) use only a finite and fixed number of bits to encode
a floating point number.
A finite representation means that only finitely many different
numbers can be encoded, so there must be an upper limit.

IEEE 754 is almost universally adopted now,
and general computing will use the ubiquitous 32- and 64-bit binary formats.
On such a scheme, the largest (finite) number you can represent
is somewhere between 1e308 and 2e308.

So while we can store the number 1e308 in a Python variable,
even quite straightforward looking computations will overflow
and give `inf` as the result:

    >>> big = 1e308
    >>> big
    1e+308
    >>> big + big
    inf

Getting an infinity can be a bit tricky.
In Python an infinity prints as `inf`
(technically its `repr` is `"inf"`), but you can't use `inf` as
a literal:

    >>> big = inf
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'inf' is not defined

You _can_ use the `float()` function:

    >>> float("inf")
    inf

You can also use a Very Big Number:

    >>> 9e999
    inf

And as previously observed `numpy` comes with a module variable:

    numpy.inf

(You _could_ also `pip install inf` and then use `import inf`,
but my friend created that mostly as a joke).


## Is one infinity enough?

So, `inf` is bigger than all other (finite) numbers.
What about the other end of the real number line?
If `big` is a number, shouldn't `-big` also be a number?

For infinity, opinions vary, but IEEE 754 settle on _two_
infinities, one positive, one negative:

    >>> -float("inf")
    -inf

`-inf` is less then (in the sense of `<`) all other (finite) numbers.

## Division

You may know other fun facts about infinity:
it's the _image_ of 0 under the _reciprocal function_.
Which is fancy words for `1/0 == inf`.
Except that in Python you get an `Exception`:

    >>> 1/0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Except if you use `numpy`:

    >>> numpy.array(1)/numpy.array(0)
    inf

(you may get a warning)

It makes sense that `1 / inf` is 0:

    >>> 1/float("inf")
    0.0

What about `1 / -inf`?

    >>> 1/-float("inf")
    -0.0

Yes, there's a negative zero.
If you have a positive and negative infinity it turns out to be
useful to have a positive and a negative zero.
